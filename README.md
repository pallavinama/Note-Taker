The HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript were provided on this project - I wrote the backend code defining all routes used to make the app work. This app uses Express to handle routing for GET, POST, and DELETE requests. It uses the Node FS module to read the JSON file containing the saved notes, as well as to update the JSON file when notes are added or deleted.
